\arguments{
\item{files}{IPCAPS2 supports SNPs encoded as 0, 1 and 2 (dosage encoding).
Rows represent SNPs and columns represent subjects. Each column needs to be
separated by a space or a tab. A big text file should be divided into smaller
files to load faster. For instance, to input 3 files, use as: files=c(
'input1.txt', 'input2.txt', 'input3.txt').}

\item{label.file}{An additional useful information (called "labels" in
IPCAPS2) related subject, for example, geographic location or disease
phenotype. These labels (one at a time) are used in displaying the clustering
outcome of IPCAPS2. A label file must contain at least one column. However,
it may contain more than one column in which case each column need to be
separated by a space or a tab.}

\item{lab.col}{The label in the label file to be used in the tree-like
display of IPCAPS2 clustering results.}

\item{rdata.infile}{In case of re-analysis, it is convenient to run IPCAPS2
using the file rawdata.RData generated by IPCAPS2. This file contains a matrix
of SNPs
(raw.data) and a vector of labels (label).}

\item{bed.infile}{A PLINK binary format consists of 3 files; bed, bim, and
fam. To generate these files from PLINK, use option â€“make-bed. See more
details at: \url{http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/data.shtml}.}

\item{cate.list}{(Unimplemented) A list of categorical input file (text). For
instance, to input 3 files, use as: files=c('input1.txt', 'input2.txt',
'input3.txt').}

\item{result.dir}{To set an absolute path for IPCAPS2 output. If the specified output
directory already exists, result files are saved in sub-directories
cluster_out, cluster_out1, cluster_out2, etc.}

\item{threshold}{Cutoff value for EigenFit.}

\item{min.fst}{Minimum Fst between a pair of subgroups.}

\item{reanalysis}{(Unimplemented) To specify whether it is re-analysis or
not. If TRUE, it is re-analysis, otherwise it is not. Default = FALSE.}

\item{method}{The internal clustering method. It can be set to "mix"
(rubikclust & mixmod), "mixmod" (Lebret et al., 2015), "clara" (R: Clustering
Large Applications), "pam" (R: Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) Object),
"meanshift" (Wang, 2016), "apcluster" (Bodenhofer et al., 2016), and "hclust"
(R: Hierarchical Clustering). Default = "mix".}

\item{min.in.group}{Minimum number of individuals to constitute a cluster or
subgroup.}

\item{datatype}{To specify whether the input data are 'snp' or other type.
Defalut = 'snp'.}

\item{nonlinear}{(Unimplemented) To specify whether linear or non-linear
method is used for IPCAPS2 analysis. If TRUE, non-linear method is used,
otherwise linear method is used. Default = FALSE.}

\item{missing.char}{Symbol used for missing genotypes. Default = NA.}

\item{regression.file}{A file of covariates; one covariate per column. SNPs
can be adjusted for these covariates via regression modeling and residual
computation.}

\item{regression.col.first}{Refer to a covariate file, the first covariate to
be considered as confounding variable.}

\item{regression.col.last}{Refer to a covariate file, the last covariate to be
considered as confounding variable. All the variables in between the
cov.col.first and cov.col.last will be considered in the adjustment process.}

\item{reg.method}{(Fixed) Specify a method for regression analysis.
Default = 'linear'.}

\item{plot.as.pdf}{To export plots as PDF. When omitted, plots are saved as
PNG.}

\item{no.plot}{No plot is generated if this option is TRUE. This option is
useful when the system does not support X Windows in the unix based system.
Default = FALSE.}

\item{silence.mode}{To enable or disable silence mode. If silence mode is
enabled, the fuction is processed without printing any message on the screen,
and it is slightly faster. Default = TRUE.}

\item{max.thread}{To specify a number of threads in order to run an analysis
in parallel. If max.thread is specified more than the maximum number of CPU
cores, then the maximum number of CPU cores are used instead. If max.thread
is specified as floating point number, it will be rounded up using the
function round(). Default = 0, which the maximum number of CPU cores are
used.}

\item{seed}{To specify a seed number for random generator. Default = NA,
which means that a seed number is automatically chose.}
