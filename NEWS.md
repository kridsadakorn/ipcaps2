# IPCAPS 1.1.8

* Updated the package according to R v4.0.2
* Reduce the sizes of example files

# IPCAPS 1.1.7

* Updated the functions to support re-analysis when the result files are moved to another directory; top.discriminator, ipcaps.
* top.discriminator now accepts a percentile for filtering.


# IPCAPS 1.1.6

* Corrected descripton of export.gorups


# IPCAPS 1.1.5

* Added more details in roxygen part of ipcaps-package.R
* Fixed text according to comments from CRAN
* Updated README.md according to the changes above


# IPCAPS 1.1.4

* Added references in the DESCRIPTION file
* Added single quotes for Software's names in the DESCRRIPTION file


# IPCAPS 1.1.3

*Fixed Text in DESCRIPTION and README.Rmd

# IPCAPS 1.1.2

* Removed all examples for roxygen2 for all internal functions
* Removed all "library(IPCAPS)" in unit tests and examples
* All example files were changed from ```simSNP*``` to ```IPCAPS_example*``` 
* Added example file in inst/extdata/IPCAPS_example.RData to used in the example of ipcaps()


# IPCAPS 1.1.1

* Added unit testing, testthat/test_clusteringmode.R
* Moved the nested functions in pasre.categorical.data and preprocess to parallelization.R
* Added roxygen2 code to pasre.categorical.data, replace.missing, do.glm
* In roxygen part, changed from getwd() to tempdir()
* Fixed errors according to check as cran
* Fixed function,  preprocess(): changed filename.label to label.file


# IPCAPS 1.1.0

* In check.stopping(), changed from eigen.fit = max(eigen.fit.vec[1:2]) to eigen.fit = max(eigen.fit.vec). This change may affect clustering result.


# IPCAPS 1.0.7

* Added data
```
* data/IPCAPS_example.RData
* inst/extdata/IPCAPS_example.bed
* inst/extdata/IPCAPS_example.bim
* inst/extdata/IPCAPS_example.fam
* inst/extdata/IPCAPS_example.individuals.txt
* inst/extdata/IPCAPS_example_PC10.txt
* inst/extdata/IPCAPS_example_rowVar_colInd.txt
```

* Added R file to describe data files, R/data.R

* Added unit testing
```
* testthat/test_caleigenfit.R
* testthat/test_checkstopping.R
```

# IPCAPS 1.0.6

* Removed the old RD files and added roxygen script to create manual for these functions:
```
save.plots.cluster.html
save.plots.label.html
save.plots
top.discriminator
```


# IPCAPS 1.0.5

* Fixed functions, Removed the old RD files and added roxygen script to create manual for these functions:
```
preprocess
process.each.node
save.eigenplots
save.html
```

# IPCAPS 1.0.4.0

* Fixed functions and objects, removed the old RD files and added roxygen script to create manual for these 
functions and objects:
```
IPCAPS-package
ipcaps
.template
postprocess
```
---

# IPCAPS 1.0.3.0

* Fixed functions, eemoved the old RD files and added roxygen script to create manual for these functions:
```
diff.eigen.fit
diff.xy
export.groups
get.node.info
```

# IPCAPS 1.0.2.0

* Fixed functions, removed the old RD files and added roxygen script to create manual for these functions:

```
cal.eigen.fit
check.stopping
clustering.mode
clustering
```

# IPCAPS 1.0.1

```
cal.pc.linear
```

# IPCAPS 1.0.0

## Initial functions

* ```cal.pc.linear``` A function for linear principal component analysis (PCA)
* ```fst.each.snp.hudson``` A function for fixation index (Fst) calculation for 
all SNPs between two groups.
* ```fst.hudson``` A function for average fixation index (Fst) calculation 
between two groups.
* ```plot3views``` A function to create scatter plots in three views.
* ```read.bed``` Read the binary PLINK format (BED, BIM, and FAM)
* ```rubikclust``` A function for unsupervised clustering to detect rough 
structures and outliers.
* ```write.bed``` Write an list of SNP object to the binary PLINK format (BED, 
BIM, and FAM)
* ```xxt``` A function for calculating matrix multipication between a matrix and 
its transpose for large data.

## Initial R data 

* ```simsnp``` Synthetic dataset containing single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNP)
* ```sample_labels``` Synthetic dataset containing population labels for the 
dataset simsnp.

## Initial example files

* ```example_SNP.bed``` Synthetic dataset containing single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNP) in binary format
* ```example_SNP.bim``` Simulated SNP information
* ```example_SNP.fam``` Simulated sample information

## Updates

From the initial idea, some functions were changed their names:

* The name of function ```cal.PC.linear``` was changed to ```cal.pc.linear```.
* The name of function ```plot.3views``` was changed to ```plot3views```.
* The name of function ```rubikClust``` was changed to ```rubikclust```.
* The name of function ```XXt``` was changed to ```xxt```.
